# This is the original US font table plus some modifications to adapt it for
# other Latin-1 languages.

# Several texts use these char replacement for button and gender symbols
# We shouldn't re-arrange as the original text already use these code-points.
# Font 6 has the button symbols shifted 1 but it looks like a bug.

# The rest of original replacements are only used in corrupted "ban names" and the keyword
# so we take the freedom to arrange all chars we don't plan to use to include all our European chars.
# We need to map the characters in the function range: ðñòóôõö÷øùúûüýþÿ
# and the three characters replaced for the button symbols: ÀÁÂ
# We also unmap some European symbols needed like: ªº«»
# We keep symbols as the original game for fancy player names.

# Move to their correct place existing characters.
